Implement an internal Calendar system and submenu navigation.

A) Replace EventsCalendar.co embed:
- Remove the current calendar embed usage entirely.
- Build a native calendar page at /calendar powered by CMS events.
- Calendar must have:
  1) Month grid view (with days, event chips)
  2) Agenda/List view (upcoming events with cards)
  3) Clicking an event opens either:
     - a modal with key details + CTA buttons, AND/OR
     - links to /events/:slug
- Design should visually resemble EventsCalendar.co: clean, modern, readable, mobile-friendly.
- Include filtering controls:
  - Status: Open / Upcoming / Closed
  - Category: Car Cruise / Street Market / Night Market / Other (optional)
- Performance: only load events once and cache for 10 minutes (same pattern as elsewhere).

B) CMS fields to support calendar + event cards:
- In Events collection, ensure these fields exist:
  - title
  - startDate (datetime)
  - endDate (datetime optional)
  - timeText (optional display string)
  - location
  - description
  - status (open/upcoming/closed)
  - category (select: car-cruise, street-market, night-market, other)
  - heroImage (image upload)
  - links object:
      links:
        vendor: { label, url }
        sponsor: { label, url }
        attend: { label, url }
  - featured (bool)
- Backwards compatibility: components must support old flat fields vendorUrl/sponsorUrl/attendeeUrl if they exist.

C) Admin UX:
- Make the Events editor NOT text heavy:
  - Order fields: Title, Dates, Hours, Location, Status, Category, Hero image, Description, Links.
  - Hide slug or auto-generate from title; editors should never type slug.
  - Add “Preview URL” hint (read-only) that shows:
    /events/<slug>
- When admin publishes a new event, it must automatically appear in:
  - /events
  - /calendar (month + list)
  after Netlify rebuild, with no manual code edits.

D) Submenu navigation:
- In Pages CMS collection, add fields:
  - showInMenu (bool)
  - menuLabel (string)
  - parentMenu (relation/select) to choose a parent page that is also showInMenu
  - menuOrder (number)
- Update site navigation builder:
  - Top-level items: showInMenu=true and no parentMenu
  - Submenu items: showInMenu=true and parentMenu set
  - Sort by menuOrder
- Render dropdown submenu on desktop; accordion submenu on mobile.
- Example should support: Events > Car Cruise / Street Market / Night Market.

Deliverables:
- Updated Decap config.yml for Events and Pages (fields + better labels)
- Updated React routes and UI for /calendar
- Updated nav rendering for submenu
- Ensure CMS Publish creates commits via Git Gateway (no shell or git push for content edits).
