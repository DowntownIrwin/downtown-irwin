Build a production-ready website for “Downtown Irwin (IBPA)” that will eventually replace irwinbpa.com and include irwincarcruise.org content.

Tech:
- React + Vite
- Static build output suitable for GitHub Pages deployment
- No server-side rendering required
- Site content is driven by JSON from a Google Apps Script endpoint (CMS in Google Sheets)

Core requirements:
1) Pages:
- Home (/)
- Events index (/events)
- Event detail (/events/:slug)
- Calendar (/calendar) embedding EventsCalendar.co (embed code comes from CMS JSON)
- Vendors (/vendors) with per-event vendor signup links
- Sponsors (/sponsors) showing sponsorship tier cards and “Sponsor Now” buttons
- Car Cruise hub (/car-cruise) (pulls from the event with slug containing “car-cruise”)
- Street Market hub (/street-market)
- Night Market hub (/night-market)
- Contact (/contact)

2) CMS/JSON:
- Create a config file src/config.ts with:
  - CMS_BASE_URL = "<APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL>"
  - SPONSORS_LOGO_JSON_URL = "https://jotform-sponsor-fetch.replit.app/api/sponsors.json" (existing)
- On app load, fetch:
  - `${CMS_BASE_URL}?route=site`
  - `${CMS_BASE_URL}?route=events`
  - `${CMS_BASE_URL}?route=sponsorTiers`
- Cache responses in localStorage for 10 minutes for speed.

3) Sponsors:
- Sponsors page shows tier cards from sponsorTiers with benefits and Square URL buttons.
- Add a “Sponsor logos” section that fetches SPONSORS_LOGO_JSON_URL and renders:
  - presenting, gold, silver logos
  - supporting sponsor names text-only
- If tiers all empty, show “Sponsors to be announced soon…”

4) Events:
- Events index shows cards grouped by status (Open / Upcoming / Closed).
- Each event card includes buttons:
  - Vendor Signup
  - Sponsor This Event
  - Attend/Register (optional)
- Event detail page shows the same plus cap/status.

5) Calendar:
- Calendar page renders an embed HTML snippet provided by CMS JSON field `events_calendar_embed`.

6) Styling:
- Clean, civic/professional vibe, mobile-first.
- No drastic color schemes required; use neutral defaults.
- Keep it “Wix-simple”: big buttons, editable sections, obvious CTAs.

Deliverables:
- Provide full file tree
- Ensure `npm run build` produces a working static site
- Include deployment instructions for GitHub Pages including copying index.html to 404.html
