Fix the CMS workflow + redesign the Decap admin UI so it’s novice-friendly.

GOAL WORKFLOW (must be true):
- Editors only use /admin.
- Clicking “Publish” in Decap MUST create a commit in GitHub via Netlify Git Gateway automatically.
- No one should ever run git add/commit/push in shell for content changes.
- After a CMS Publish, Netlify rebuilds and the new/edited event/gallery/page appears on the live site.

1) Fix persistence:
- Ensure Decap config uses:
  backend:
    name: git-gateway
    branch: main
- Ensure /admin/config.yml is served in production at /admin/config.yml (no SPA redirect swallowing it).
- Ensure Netlify Identity widget is loaded in /admin:
  <script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"></script>
- Ensure Netlify redirects allow admin assets:
  /admin/* must NOT be routed to /index.html.
  Use redirects like:
    /admin/*  /admin/:splat  200
    /*        /index.html     200
- Confirm that publishing creates commits under GitHub “Commits” (this is the acceptance test).

2) Make new Events/Galleries/Pages appear automatically WITHOUT editing code:
- Use Vite’s import.meta.glob for content loading so newly added JSON files are picked up on rebuild:
  - events: client/src/content/events/*.json
  - galleries: client/src/content/galleries/*.json
  - pages: client/src/content/pages/*.json
- Ensure the code does NOT use hardcoded arrays of imports.
- Ensure list pages use the glob results to build the list.
- Acceptance test: create a new event in /admin, publish; it appears on /events after deploy.

3) Remove “slug” from the editor experience:
- Editors should never type a slug.
- In Decap config.yml:
  - Remove the “slug” field from Events and Galleries forms entirely.
  - Set the collection slug template to auto-generate from title:
      slug: "{{title}}"
    (Decap will slugify automatically.)
  - Set identifier_field: "title" so lists show titles clearly.
- If a slug is still needed internally, generate it automatically on save from title (do not show field).

4) Make the admin feel less text-heavy:
- Rework labels and hints to be human:
  - “Time Text” → “Hours (example: 12–4 PM)”
  - “Vendor Signup URL” → “Vendor Signup Link (Square/Jotform)”
  - “Sponsor URL” → “Sponsor Link”
  - “Status” → dropdown with friendly values:
     Open (taking signups), Upcoming, Closed
- Add helper hints to every field.
- Make optional fields truly optional (required: false).
- Group link fields into a single object “Buttons/Links” if supported (widget: object).
- Put the most-used fields at top: Title, Date, Hours, Location, Description, Status.
- Set sensible defaults: status=Upcoming.

5) Add “Preview” buttons inside the CMS:
- Add a read-only field or UI hint that shows:
  - Event URL: /events/{slug}
  - Gallery URL: /gallery/{slug}
- If possible, add a preview link button in the editor sidebar.

DELIVERABLES:
- Update client/public/admin/config.yml with the simplified fields, auto-slug, and better labels/hints.
- Ensure /admin works on the Netlify domain and Publish creates GitHub commits.
- Update site code to use import.meta.glob for content loading so new entries appear automatically after rebuild.
- Update README with “Editor workflow” steps (no git, no Replit).
