Upgrade the Decap CMS admin UX and add scheduling + previews.

NON-NEGOTIABLE WORKFLOW:
- Editors ONLY use /admin.
- Clicking Publish in /admin MUST create a GitHub commit via Netlify Git Gateway.
- Netlify rebuilds automatically.
- No shell commands, no git push for content edits.

PART 1 — Make /admin UX-friendly (keep same functionality)
A) Remove tech/jargon from editors
- Hide slug completely (do not show a slug field anywhere).
- Auto-generate the filename/slug from Title.
- In Decap config:
  - collection slug should be based on title (slug: "{{title}}") and let Decap slugify.
  - identifier_field should be "title" for lists.

B) Make forms less text-heavy
- Re-label and re-order fields so editors see the important stuff first.
- Use grouped sections (object widgets) so it feels like “cards”:
  1) Basics: Title, Date(s), Hours, Location, Category, Status
  2) Content: Description, Hero Image
  3) Buttons & Links: Vendor/Sponsor/Attend buttons
  4) Optional: Gallery, Featured toggle

C) Add friendly labels + hints + defaults everywhere
- Status options shown as:
  - Open (registration live)
  - Upcoming (not open yet)
  - Closed (registration closed)
- Defaults:
  - status default: Upcoming
  - category default: Other
- Add short hints on every field (what it affects on the site).

PART 2 — Preview while editing (Wix-like)
Goal: editors can preview what they are editing without guessing.

Implement BOTH of these:

A) “Preview” button/links inside the CMS editor
- On Events edit screen, show a read-only field with:
  Preview URL: /events/<auto-slug>
- On Pages edit screen:
  Preview URL: /<page-slug>
- On Galleries edit screen:
  Preview URL: /galleries/<auto-slug>
These should be clickable links.

B) Live preview panel (best effort, same session)
- Add a “Preview” pane in the admin UI that updates while typing:
  - simplest acceptable: an iframe that loads the site preview route and refreshes on Save Draft
  - preferred: update live via postMessage from CMS to the preview iframe
- Create site routes for preview mode:
  - /preview/event
  - /preview/page
  - /preview/gallery
The preview route should accept JSON via postMessage and render using the same React components used on the live pages.

Acceptance criteria:
- While editing an event, editor can click Preview and see the event card + detail page layout with their content.
- No need to Publish just to see what it will look like.

PART 3 — Scheduling: future posts + automatic open/close registration
We need “publish at a future date” behavior AND “open/close registration automatically”.

IMPORTANT: This is a static site, so do NOT rely on background jobs or scheduled commits.
Instead, implement time-based display logic in the site runtime (so it works immediately without redeploy once published).

Add these fields:

A) Events scheduling + registration automation
- Add fields to each Event:
  - visibleFrom (datetime, optional)  // event appears on site after this time
  - visibleUntil (datetime, optional) // event hidden after this time
  - registrationOpensAt (datetime, optional)
  - registrationClosesAt (datetime, optional)

Site behavior:
- Event visibility:
  - if visibleFrom is set and now < visibleFrom => hide from events list/calendar
  - if visibleUntil is set and now > visibleUntil => hide
- Registration status:
  - if registrationOpensAt exists and now < registrationOpensAt => show status “Upcoming” and disable registration buttons (or label “Opens on …”)
  - if registrationClosesAt exists and now > registrationClosesAt => show status “Closed” and disable registration buttons (or label “Closed”)
  - otherwise if editor set status=Open => show active buttons

Buttons:
- For vendor/sponsor/attend buttons, render only if URL exists AND registration is currently open (unless editor overrides with a “Force show buttons” boolean).

B) Scheduled posts / announcements
Add a CMS collection “Announcements” (or “Updates”) with:
- title
- body
- image (optional)
- link (optional)
- publishAt (datetime optional)
- expireAt (datetime optional)
- pinned (boolean)
Site behavior:
- Home page shows announcements where:
  - now >= publishAt (or no publishAt)
  - now <= expireAt (or no expireAt)
- Sort pinned first, then newest.

Admin UX:
- Make scheduling fields optional and clearly labeled:
  - “Show starting (optional)”
  - “Hide after (optional)”
  - “Registration opens (optional)”
  - “Registration closes (optional)”
- Add hints that explain: “Set this if you want it to flip automatically.”

PART 4 — Submenu support (requested)
In Pages CMS:
- showInMenu (bool)
- menuLabel (string)
- parentMenu (select/relation) to choose a parent menu item
- menuOrder (number)

Nav rendering:
- Top-level = showInMenu true and parentMenu empty
- Sub-menu = showInMenu true and parentMenu set
- Desktop dropdown + mobile accordion.

DELIVERABLES:
- Updated client/public/admin/config.yml with the improved UX, no slug field, grouped widgets, hints, defaults.
- New content types for announcements + scheduling fields.
- Updated React site logic for time-based visibility and registration open/close.
- Preview routes + preview pane implementation (at least clickable preview links; preferred iframe preview with postMessage).
- README updates for editors explaining:
  - how to create events
  - how to schedule visibility
  - how registration open/close works
  - how preview works
