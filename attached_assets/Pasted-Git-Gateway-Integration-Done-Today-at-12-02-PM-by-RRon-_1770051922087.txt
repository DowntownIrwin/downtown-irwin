Result
This project uses Git Gateway as the backend for Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS), enabling non-technical editors to manage website content through a visual interface without needing Git knowledge.

Current Git Gateway Configuration

CMS Backend Setup

The CMS configuration at client/public/admin/config.yml specifies Git Gateway as the backend:

backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main
This allows authenticated users to commit content changes directly to the main branch via Netlify's Git Gateway service.

Identity Widget Integration

The Netlify Identity widget is integrated in two locations:

Main site (client/index.html) - Loads the identity widget and auto-redirects authenticated users to /admin/ on login
Admin interface (client/public/admin/index.html) - Loads both the identity widget and Decap CMS for the editorial experience
Redirect Configuration

The netlify.toml and client/public/_redirects files ensure the admin interface is served correctly:

/admin/* routes are served directly (not treated as SPA routes)
All other routes fall back to index.html for client-side routing
Content Management

The CMS manages several content collections stored as JSON files:

Events - client/src/content/events/
Pages - client/src/content/pages/
Photo Galleries - client/src/content/galleries/
Site Settings - client/src/content/site.json
Sponsor Tiers - client/src/content/sponsors/tiers.json
Media uploads are stored in client/public/uploads and served at /uploads.

Netlify Setup Requirements

For Git Gateway to function, the following must be configured in the Netlify dashboard:

Enable Netlify Identity - Site settings > Identity > Enable Identity
Set registration to "Invite only" - Recommended for security
Enable Git Gateway - Site settings > Identity > Services > Enable Git Gateway
Invite editors - Identity tab > Invite users via email
Ensure Git permissions - Git Gateway requires read/write access to the connected repository
How It Works

When an editor publishes content through Decap CMS:

Editor authenticates via Netlify Identity at /admin/
Makes changes using the visual CMS interface
Clicks "Publish" to commit changes
Git Gateway commits the changes to GitHub on the user's behalf
The site rebuilds and deploys automatically
This setup provides a complete content management workflow without requiring editors to interact with Git directly.
